# Research Group of Mikhail Mikhasenko

![](logo/ep1mikhasenko_logo_small.svg)

The Research Group lead by Mikhail Mikhasenko at Ruhr-University Bochum specializes in hadron spectroscopy, delving into the fascinating world of strong interaction at the regime of confined quarks and gluons. Focused on exotic multiquark configurations, such as pentaquarks and tetraquarks, their work bridges nuclear and particle physics. As part of the LHCb collaboration, and the COMPASS collaboration at CERN, they are instrumental in detector operation, data analysis, and particle phenomenology. The group excels in integrating theoretical models with experimental data, fostering strong national and international collaborations. Their work enhances our understanding of both heavy and light flavor physics, advancing the field of particle physics.
